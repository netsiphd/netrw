class LocalEdgeRewiring(BaseRewirer):
    """Perturb one edge of node `i` in the way described by Klein & McCabe
    (2019). Select a random node `i`, randomly select one of its edges `ij`,
    delete `ij` and add a new edge `ik` where `k` is a neighbor of `j` (i.e.,
    a "friend of friend" rewiring where `jk` is an edge present in the graph).

    If `ij` is a weighted edge, its weight gets carried over to the new edge
    `ik`.

    Details:
    - Does not produce multi-edges.
    - Is not implemented specifically for directed graphs. (Could be though.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        G (networkx graph)
            The original network in question.

        copy_graph (bool)
            Useful parameter for making sure input data doesnt change.

        -------
        G (networkx graph)
            The graph with a single rewired edge. If the algorithm randomly
            attempts to rewire in a location where no rewirings are permitted,
            the graph does not change and the original G is returned.
